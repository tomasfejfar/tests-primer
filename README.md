# Tests primer

This repository contains minimal code required to run test on your project. It's intended as drop-in. Just copy and paste all the files here to your project. 

You'll also need phpunit from composer. 

    composer require phpunit/phpunit
	
Then run your tests using

    vendor/bin/phpunit
	
(or `vendor\bin\phpunit` on Windows)
